# Important Note before pushing

-  If we want to correctly use update files, he/she needs to generate ssh key by: 

  ```git
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your@email.com"
  ```

  then:

  You can go to C:\User\administrator\.ssh\ 

  to check whether you got his key

- Then, add the ssh key to your github account

- open your git bash, enter these two commands:

  ``` git
  ssh-agent bash
  ```

  ```git
  ssh-add ~/.ssh/Tmech2020_key1
  ```

  Then you add your ssh key in your computer

- You could use command to push

  ```git
  git push -u origin main
  ```

# When single file is larger than 500MB
